Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Chloe Wahl-Dussle (I only consulted one classmate because I had COVID during the assignment time)
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
N/A (I had COVID)
- What are your initial impressions of Java?
It is less intuitive for me that python is, but working through this assignment helped me build knowledge and confidence.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
My main conclusion is that programming is all about logical thinking, and that different languages support this thinking in different ways. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would give the advice to comment out what different lines do with //. In the middle, I was having problems with my code and couldn't figure out what was going wrong because the amount of code was overwhelming. I picked through it line by line and commented out what different lines were doing. Understanding the lines with English text helped me figure out my errors and fix them.
